    "It is very important to write readable and understandable code. This is a practical matter. There are times when you have to go back and make changes to code you have not used in a long time. More importantly, coding is a shared activity, and if your code is not readable then it is not of any use.\n",

The standard for which Python program are written to is called [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) and contains the following basic guidelines:\n",
    " - Use 4-space indentation, no tabs\n",
    " - Wrap lines that exceed 80 characters\n",
    " - Use judicious use of blank lines to separate out functions, classes, and larger blocks of contained code\n",
    " - Comment!  Also, put comments on their own line when possible\n",
    " - Use `docstrings` (function descriptions)\n",
    " - Use spaces around operators and after commas, `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`\n",
    " - Name your classes and functions consistently.\n",
    "   - Use `CamelCase` for classes\n",
    "   - Use `lower_case_with_underscores` for functions and variables\n",
